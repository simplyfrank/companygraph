## Summary

A modeling pipeline on top of the companygraph process graph: author any
business's workflows across roles as first-class user stories with
Given/When/Then acceptance criteria (the "complete specification of a
business"), land the model in the graph, identify and optimize the key
activities, make those activities measurable through quantified KPI
impact, and use the process requirements as the base for domain-driven
IT system modeling (capabilities, bounded contexts, support-gap
analysis).

The pipeline is: **author → graph → optimize → measure → systematize**.
Multiple business models coexist side-by-side and share **versioned,
journey-level business modules**.

**Round-4 extension (user ask, 2026-07-04):** manage the business from
this view. Three additions: (1) every augmenting IT system is classified
**functional / agentic / AI-predictive** (`systemKind` foundation
vocabulary consumed by DDD modeling, dashboards, and analytics);
(2) the adopted-but-ungoverned KPI/OKR/roll-down surface gets its owed
**governance backfill** (verification + integration tests) as a
foundation, and a **KPI/OKR performance dashboard** (`#/exec/performance`)
provides trends, target/breach status, and OKR roll-down control sliceable
by augmentation kind; (3) support for domain experts modeling key
activities per role is **verified through explicit ACs** in the authoring
specs (XD-18), not assumed. Mode: **single-shot** (XD-17).

Reuses as-built surfaces (never re-specs them): graph-core CRUD +
import, ontology-manager runtime registry, journey-versions route
pattern, KPI/SLA routes + Postgres measurements, `DRIVES_KPI` /
`userStoryKPI` schemas, bounded-contexts + glossary routes,
persona/RBAC subsystem.

## View Tree (frozen at blueprint approval)

New top-level **Model** surface in `pwa/src/route.ts`, following the
existing `#/<surface>/<tab>` convention. `model-workspace-core` owns the
`route.ts` registration for ALL Model tabs (one feature owns a file).

```
#/model                     → Model surface        [owner: model-workspace-core]
├── #/model/models          → ModelWorkspace       [owner: model-workspace-core]
├── #/model/canvas          → ModelCanvas          [owner: business-model-authoring]
├── #/model/stories         → StoryCatalog         [owner: story-spec-core]
├── #/model/key-activities  → KeyActivityBoard     [owner: key-activity-optimizer]
├── #/model/kpi-impact      → KpiImpactMatrix      [owner: kpi-impact-mapping]
├── #/model/systems         → SystemModeler        [owner: ddd-system-modeling]
└── #/model/export          → SpecExport           [owner: requirements-export]
```

| Route | View component | Owner (slug) | Nav surface | States specced |
|-------|----------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| `#/model/models` | `ModelWorkspace` | `model-workspace-core` | Model tab | loading·empty·error·ready |
| `#/model/canvas` | `ModelCanvas` | `business-model-authoring` | Model tab | loading·empty·error·ready |
| `#/model/stories` | `StoryCatalog` | `story-spec-core` | Model tab | loading·empty·error·ready |

| `#/model/export` | `SpecExport` | `requirements-export` | Model tab | loading·empty·error·ready |

Round-4 additions on EXISTING surfaces (no new surface):

```
#/exec/performance    → PerformanceDashboard  [owner: kpi-okr-performance-dashboards]  NEW exec tab
#/explorer/systems    → (existing view gains systemKind badges + filter)
                                              [owner: system-augmentation-model]
#/exec/kpi-management, #/exec/okr-management  → existing views, verified + tested
                                              [owner: kpi-okr-governance]
```

| Route | View component | Owner (slug) | Nav surface | States specced |
|-------|----------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| `#/exec/performance` | `PerformanceDashboard` | `kpi-okr-performance-dashboards` | Exec tab | loading·empty·error·ready |

Active-model context (which BusinessModel the user is working in) is a
shell-level concern owned by `model-workspace-core`; every other Model
view consumes it, never reimplements it.

## UI/UX Allowances

| ID | Allowance | Requirement |
|----|-----------|-------------|
| UX-01 | View states | Every view specs loading / empty / error / ready states in its ACs |
| UX-02 | Design system | Tokens only; components from the catalog before inventing new ones; `scripts/design-conformance.ts` passes on every touched view |
| UX-03 | Input modes | Platforms & Input Modes + Native Conflicts tables for any canvas/gesture work (ModelCanvas) |
| UX-04 | Responsiveness | Desktop-first, matching the existing PWA; no new breakpoints |
| UX-05 | Accessibility | Keyboard reachability, focus order, ARIA landmarks per view |
| UX-06 | Navigation | Routes from this View Tree verbatim; deep links survive reload; active-model context survives reload |

---

## Cross-Cutting Decisions

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| XD-01 | New labels (BusinessModel, BusinessModule/version nodes, UserStory, AcceptanceCriterion, Capability) are **runtime ontology labels** via the ontology-manager registry, not compile-time `NODE_LABELS` additions | The registry is the sanctioned extension path; keeps the core stable |
| XD-02 | Story/AC/model/module data in **Neo4j**; no new store. **Amended (final ruling 2026-07-04):** canonical KPI-measurement source for roll-ups/trends/dashboards is Neo4j **`:KPIMeasurement`** (what the governed `kpi-trends` reads); the Postgres `kpi_measurements` table stays as-built for the routes that own it — the split-brain is documented, not fixed, by this app | Zero-migration path; consistent with XD-04 and the shipped read paths |
| XD-03 | "Key activity" is an **attribute + score evidence**, not a new label | Activities stay one label; scores recomputable, marking reversible |
| XD-04 | KPI impact rides the as-built **`ALIGNED_TO`** edge (activity→KPI) + `userStoryKPI` link schema, **extended with direction + quantified weight**; a runtime `IMPACTS_KPI` edge covers story→KPI (Round 3; rejected: qualitative-only). Roll-up reads the governed `kpi-trends` route, whose source is Neo4j **`:KPIMeasurement`** (user decision 2026-07-04; the Postgres `kpi_measurements` split-brain is left as-is — not this app's fix). NB: the literal `DRIVES_KPI` named in earlier drafts is `KeyResult→KPI`, not the weighted activity link — see kpi-impact-mapping DEC-01/OQ-1 | "Measurable" = directional, weighted impact links + coverage scoring + roll-up vs the `:KPIMeasurement` source |
| XD-05 | DDD modeling extends the existing **bounded-contexts** ontology surface with a Capability layer | Context CRUD exists; this adds story→capability→system mapping on top |
| XD-06 | **Multiple business models side-by-side**; scoping via a BusinessModel root each subgraph hangs off (Round 1; rejected: single evolving model) | Model a client's business next to the retail reference |
| XD-07 | **Business modules are journey-level, versioned, instantiated per model** — publish at version, models reference a version, in-model edits fork a local instance, upgrades explicit (Round 2; rejected: live share-by-reference, copy-only) | Predictable isolation with a path to roll improvements across models |
| XD-08 | **New Business Architect persona** owns model-authoring write paths via the existing persona/RBAC subsystem (Round 1; rejected: extending SME) | SME keeps review/annotate |
| XD-09 | Stories bootstrap by **generate-then-edit** — one-click derivation from graph structure creates editable persisted nodes (Round 1; rejected: author-only). Server-side port of `pwa/src/lib/userStories.ts` | Keeps today's derived behavior as the on-ramp |
| XD-10 | Acceptance criteria are **structured Given/When/Then** (Round 3; rejected: free text, both) | Machine-checkable, exports into requirements docs and future test scaffolds |
| XD-11 | Optimization is **descriptive** — scores + rankings + manual marking (Round 1; rejected: prescriptive recommendations) | Deterministic and explainable; suggestions deferred to the chat surface |
| XD-12 | The existing retail graph is **migrated to Business Model #1** (Round 3; rejected: legacy-outside) | One regime in the graph; doubles as the reference example + template source |
| XD-13 | Templates: **blank + retail reference clone** using the module-instantiation machinery (Round 3; rejected: industry library, blank-only) | Cheap; exercises the same code path as module reuse |
| XD-14 | Export is **Markdown + JSON** (Round 2; rejected: PDF) | Human + machine readable; PDF deferred (cto-analytics pattern exists if wanted later) |
| XD-15 | **`systemKind` is a required enum attribute on System** (`functional` \| `agentic` \| `ai_predictive`) via the ontology registry, seed migration defaults existing systems to `functional` (Round 4; rejected: subtype labels, per-feature enums) | One augmentation vocabulary consumed by SystemModeler, dashboards, and AI-candidate analytics; attributes keep the label registry stable |
| XD-16 | **KPI/OKR governance backfill is a foundation of this app** — the adopted kpi-*/okr-crud/roll-down/sla-* surface gets verification + integration tests before anything builds on it (Round 4; rejected: dashboards on ungoverned surface) | Clears the `_baseline` debt exactly where it becomes a dependency |
| XD-17 | **Single-shot mode** — blueprint approval authorizes spec + implementation end-to-end; deterministic gates (hooks, typecheck, tests, design-conformance) replace interactive gates until the consolidated report (Round 4) | User decision; Phase A gate carries full weight |
| XD-18 | **Verification mandate** — "domain experts can model key activities per role end-to-end" is proven by explicit ACs in `story-spec-core` + `business-model-authoring` (Role/Activity/EXECUTES + Persona write paths exercised per platform), not assumed from the as-built surface (Round 4; rejected: separate verification spec) | Verification lives where the behavior is specced; no orphan spec |

## Build Order / Milestones

| Milestone | Features | Goal |
|-----------|----------|------|
| M1 | `model-workspace-core`, `story-spec-core`, `system-augmentation-model`, `kpi-okr-governance` | Walking skeleton + augmentation vocabulary + governed KPI/OKR base |
| M2 | `business-model-authoring`, `key-activity-optimizer` | Author a new business end-to-end, rank + mark its key activities |
| M3 | `kpi-impact-mapping`, `ddd-system-modeling`, `kpi-okr-performance-dashboards` | Key activities measurable; systems mapped domain-driven with augmentation mix; performance control live |
| M4 | `requirements-export` | The complete business specification as a document |

---

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| ~~kpi backfill owed~~ — resolved: `kpi-okr-governance` is now a foundation feature of this app (XD-16) | kpi-impact-mapping and the dashboards depend on it explicitly |
| Single-shot scale: 10 pipelines ≈ 60–80 agents incl. builds; deterministic gates are the only in-run control | Foundation waves serialize the riskiest specs; hooks + typecheck + tests + design-conformance gate every artifact; consolidated report is the human checkpoint |
| Auth-hardening debt (dev fallback grants synthetic admin) is NOT in this decomposition | Tracked in PROJECT-ROLLUP; must precede any non-local deploy |
| Retail→Model #1 migration touches every existing node's scoping | Migration is idempotent + reversible in model-workspace-core's design; run behind `bun run seed`-style script with dry-run |
| Module fork/upgrade semantics are the hardest novel design | model-workspace-core is a large spec with full review depth; journey-versions route pattern is prior art |
| Canvas authoring scope explosion | Wizard-first; canvas reuses JourneyCanvas/react-flow patterns; canvas polish is `should` inside that spec |
| Runtime-registry label additions vs. compile-time expectations in older code | story-spec-core design verifies the registry path end-to-end (validators are registry-backed already) |
